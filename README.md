# Statistics-and-Machine-Learning-Individual-Assignment_2

This Exersise applies and compares supervised classification models using the Iris dataset (load_iris) with a focus on tree-based algorithms and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The dataset is split into training and testing sets to ensure fair model evaluation. Three tree-based models—Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosted Trees Classifier—are trained on the training data and used to generate predictions on the test set. In addition, a KNN classifier is implemented and evaluated across multiple values of k (from 1 to 20), with model accuracy plotted against k to identify the optimal number of neighbors. All models are evaluated using standard classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and the results are summarized in a comparison table. The findings show that ensemble methods such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting generally provide better performance and generalization than a single Decision Tree, while the KNN model performs competitively when an optimal k is selected.
